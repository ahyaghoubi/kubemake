Master Node: 192.168.251.200
User: root
Password: 131072
Setup: Single master node (no workers)
```

### 🚀 Ready for Deployment:

#### **Enhanced Quick Setup (RECOMMENDED):**
```powershell
# Navigate to kubemake directory
cd "c:\Users\Amirhossein\Documents\GitHub\fgcs-2023-artifacts-main\kubemake"

# For Linux/WSL2 users - run enhanced setup
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# For Windows users - run PowerShell setup
.\setup.ps1

# Run comprehensive validation
chmod +x pre-check.sh && ./pre-check.sh

# Deploy with ENHANCED validation and pre-flight checks (RECOMMENDED)
ansible-playbook site-improved.yml -i hosts
```

#### **Alternative Basic Deployment:**
```powershell
# Deploy with basic playbook (less validation)
ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts
```

#### **Selective Enhanced Deployment:**
```powershell
# Just Kubernetes cluster with enhanced checks
ansible-playbook site-improved.yml -i hosts --tags preflight,setup,init

# Add Istio service mesh with validation
ansible-playbook site-improved.yml -i hosts --tags mesh,telemetry

# Add chaos engineering tools
ansible-playbook site-improved.yml -i hosts --tags chaos
```

### 🔧 Post-Installation:
The playbook automatically:
- ✅ Untaints master node for single-node setup
- ✅ Configures kubectl for root user
- ✅ Waits for all services to be ready
- ✅ Validates installation

### 📊 Expected Results:
After successful deployment, you'll have:
- ✅ Kubernetes 1.30 cluster
- ✅ CRI-O container runtime
- ✅ Flannel network plugin
- ✅ Istio service mesh (if selected)
- ✅ Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger, Kiali dashboards
- ✅ Chaos Mesh (if selected)

### 🆘 Support:
